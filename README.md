## Assignment 2: Guess the Number Game in Assembly
### Tasks

- [x] Display nice message to user
- [ ] Generate random number
- [ ] Get user input
- [ ] Compare user input to random number
- [ ] Display feedback to user
- [ ] Loop until user guesses correctly
- [ ] Display nice message to user
- [ ] Exit

### Dependencies

* nasm
* gdb (for debugging)
* ld (for linking)

### How to run
1. run `$ make`
3. run `$ ./casm`
   
### Requirements:

* Develop a "Guess the Number" game in assembly language.
* Generate a random number for the user to guess.
* Provide feedback to the user after each guess (e.g., "too high" or "too low").
* Implement a loop to allow the user to keep guessing until they find the correct number.

### Restrictions:

* Use only basic arithmetic and control flow instructions.
* Minimize the use of external libraries or system calls.
* Ensure that the random number generation is implemented using low-level instructions.

### Submission Guidelines:

* Submit the assembly source code along with any necessary files for building and running the game.
* Include a README file with instructions on how to assemble and play the game.
* Write a brief report discussing the design choices and any challenges encountered.
