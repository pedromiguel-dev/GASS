# Assignment 2

## Guess the Number Game in Assembly

### Tasks

- [x] Display nice message to user
- [x] Generate random number
- [x] Get user input
- [x] Compare user input to random number
- [x] Provide feedback to the user (too high, too low)
- [x] Loop until user guesses correctly
- [x] Display nice message to user
- [x] Exit

### Dependencies

- nasm
- gdb (for debugging)
- ld (for linking)

### How to run

1. run `$ make`
2. run `$ ./build/main`
3. alternatively run `$ make run`

### Requirements

- Develop a "Guess the Number" game in assembly language.
- Generate a random number for the user to guess.
- Provide feedback to the user after each guess (e.g., "too high" or "too low").
- Implement a loop to allow the user to keep guessing until they find the correct number.

### Restrictions

- Use only basic arithmetic and control flow instructions.
- Minimize the use of external libraries or system calls.
- Ensure that the random number generation is implemented using low-level instructions.

### Submission Guidelines

- Submit the assembly source code along with any necessary files for building and running the game.
- Include a README file with instructions on how to assemble and play the game.
- Write a brief report discussing the design choices and any challenges encountered.
